# ex4 - Create Data

When we can get data, sometimes we want to create our own books and movies. 
In this exercise we will implement a creation for book and movie and add that to a local list

#### index.html
* Create a button named "Get me some movies" with an onClick event to the method addMovie()
* Create a button named "Get me some books' with an onClick event to the method addBook()

#### Library.ts
* Create a new method named addMovie() 
* Implement by adding a default movie to the Array and looping the render function.
* Repeat the previous 2 steps for Book

#### app.ts
Initialise a new instance of Library and assign getJSON to it

Run your index and check the results by pressing the buttons!
